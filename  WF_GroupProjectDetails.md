To run this project, you will need to run the following commands :

- `bundle install` to install all the required gems and dependencies
- `rake db:create db:migrate` to create the database and run the migrations
- `rake db:seed` to fill the database with the feeds

The password for the admin is `admin`

I choose to work alone for this project because it was for me simplier than the others and it allow me to learn all the parts of a rails project

There is a `.git` repository, i'm using Git and i voluntarily left it if you want to see the progression and the organisation of my project.
